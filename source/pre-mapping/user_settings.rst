User Settings
*************

All user settings, selections, and default board dimensions are customizable to your model and
saved external to the model. The only change to the model will occur when MB creates a map
object in the browser tree. This results with a single entry in the UnDo list.

The created map can be removed by performing an UnDo, CMD Z on MacOS or Ctrl Z on
Windows. Any board dimensions, settings, or selections will not be undone when the UnDo is
performed.
