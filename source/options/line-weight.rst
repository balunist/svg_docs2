Line Weight
===========

.. role:: blue

This setting controls the thickness of the lines in an SVG export. The Line Weight setting
represents the thickness of the lines as a floating-point number in the default units. The
value can be very small for thin lines or very large for thick lines.

This together with line color provides more control for laser cutting.

Shown below is a :blue:`Lineweight` of 0.05 inches for the profiles included in this SVG 
file export.
