About MapBoards
***************

MapBoards is a Fusion 360 add-in which focuses on preparing your model for
manufacturing.

The goal of this section is to give you a quick overview of what MapBoards is and how you
might use it.

MapBoards (MB) allows you to create maps, which are arrangements of component bodies
in a model on one or more boards or layouts. The arrangements are done by creating components
containing copies of the bodies in your model, leaving your original model intact. Placement
is based on a tight rectangular bounding box around each body, providing quick results and
reasonable nesting.

The map layout can be customized to match your preferences or manufacturing requirements
then saved as default. See :ref:`map_layout-label` for details.

**Try something simple…** Begin by selecting a simple design with only a few components to
become familiar with the options available. When you launch MB, it will evaluate your model
and display a list of **board types described by material types and thicknesses**. With each board
type there are two dimensions, width and length, which will be used as the default board size
when creating a map. The first time a material type is encountered these values will be set large
enough to accommodate the largest component of that board type. You can set these
dimensions to be whatever you prefer for that target board size and it will remember and use
those dimensions the next time that material type is encountered.

When executing MB make sure the option **Map Output Type** is set to **Component Bodies**,
which is the default. This selection will create and display a map of the components in your
model on their corresponding board types.

Creating a map of component bodies results in a single entry in the UnDo list labeled 
**UnDo MapBoards**. This enables you to run MB multiple times and create maps with different
options, which you can roll back and forth through using commands UnDo (Cmd-Z) and ReDo
(Shift Cmd-Z).

To Create a map you simply click the OK button. Popup messages will keep you informed of the
progress. When completed one or more mapped boards are displayed in the Top View and the
screen will be resized to view both your model and the created map. The view may be rotated
if there are multiple boards to fill your screen in more of a landscape view.

If you are using or plan to include linked components and assemblies in your model, see 
:ref:`linked-label` for details.

The dimensions you enter in the lumber tab represent the default board size that will be used
when mapping. 

Don’t worry, MB will not modify your model. A map is created as a subcomponent at the root 
of the browser tree and cleared with each run of **MB**. You can remove the map by pressing 
Cmd-Z (UnDo MapBoards) or rerunning MB and pressing ESC then OK to delete.

Experiment with the following options to get the results you desire:
  - :ref:`arrange_type-label` - choose from 3 optional arrangement types
  - :ref:`rotate-label` - permit 90 degree component rotation for best fit

For a complete list of options with descriptions, see :ref:`options-label`. You can also 
reference this options list from the table of contents.


.. note::
    Unlock the full capabilities of Fusion 360 and MapBoards by adhering to these best practices:

    - Always start by creating a component to house your 3D body and associated
      resources like sketches. Never place 3D bodies directly at the root, outside of
      a component.
    - Include only one body per component.
    - Provide your components with meaningful names, which will help navigate your model
      when it becomes more complicated.
