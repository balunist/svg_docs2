Creating Derived Model
**********************

    To create a derived model, follow these steps:

    - With the source model opened, select Derive from the create dropdown menu
    - Select the top-level component in the browser tree to include the entire model
    - Select OK in the Derive command popup to complete the creation
  
    You can now run MB on this derived model. You can save this model if you wish, but that is
    not necessary since it can easily be recreated. If you make changes to the source model, the
    symbol |out_of_date| will indicate that you are out-of-date. Click the symbol to refresh the 
    derived model.
